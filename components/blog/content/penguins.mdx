During my childhood, I remember enjoying [Penguins of Madagascar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguins_of_Madagascar). Besides finding it funny to watch at that time, I remember also being fascinated by Kowalski, the brain logic of the team, and the mastermind behind their crazy, yet creative plans.

<div className="h-[20px]" />

Kowalski represented the chill guy, who would take a problem statement, analyze the situation, detect the pain point, and set up a plan to address it in an efficient way... Yeah you guessed it right! that's what an engineer does frequently. And for me as a child, it was IT. As I imagined that this was the peak performance anyone could get at, and that by reaching such level, one would be able to be a one-man team that tackles any problem and solves it in moments... But as it will turn out... I was **wrong**!

<div className="h-[20px]" />

In fact, I found out that I was reading the whole situation wrongly, and that my admiration of Kowalski's job role made me oversea the roles that other characters played in the team, which for me (at that time) sounded less appealing, but still, made each mission of the penguins a successfull one.

In any plot that gathers these penguins, you will find a pattern that repeats itself (prolly made in purpose by the scenarists), where they approach a problem in a methodological manner. First they all get shocked by some tweak in the storytelling, Skipper takes the lead to give the first impression, he orders Kowalski to analyze the situation and crack the pain point in it. Then, once a plan to attack is formalized, Rico supplies the necessary tools right out of his stomach (yukky, but gotta admit he is the backpack we all wished for !). and Private helps executing it by being the cute and innocent one that distracts the enemy.

<div className="h-[20px]" />

straightforwrard right ?

Well... not really. This is what made the difference in this movie. each penguin knows what he is good at, and how to do it efficiently. Making those two factors (i.e. **Role Specification** and **Task Execution**) the key to their success.

<div className="h-[20px]" />

To illustrate, Skipper once tried to take kowalski's role of figuring out a smart way to save the rest of the penguins. He ended up convincing them that Penguins can actually fly because they have wings: 

<div className="h-[10px]" />

<QuoteBlock quote="Skipper: Well, fine. We'll just fly to the front of the line and see for ourselves. Kowalski, Rico, engage aerial surveillance." />
<QuoteBlock quote="(They flap their wings, but cannot fly.)" />
<QuoteBlock quote="Kowalski: Skipper, we appear to be flightless." />
<QuoteBlock quote="Skipper: [looks at his wings] Oh, well, what's the point of these?" />
<QuoteBlock quote="(Rico seems to have an idea. He hits Skipper's wing in some sort of high five.)" />

<div className="h-[10px]" />

Same goes for Task Execution, Private needs to convince the enemy each time by his innocent looks. He might fail once, but he can't fail everytime the team needs him.

<div className="h-[20px]" />

Sounds abstract and repetitive till now?

Remember any problem you had to face while being a part of a team and it would most probably fall into those two categories. I still remember many experiences where I was failing to deliver properly, either due to the task not falling into my set of expertise, or because I was not able to execute it properly (or both!).

<div className="h-[20px]" />

Realising this, urged me to prioritize those two factors before taking part at any team, as they gave me a quick insight on how beneficial would I be, and whether I was needed at first place. However, I am not arguing that this made me THE perfect team collaborater, because I do believe that it also depends on many other factors besides those two, but I try my best not to be the next penguin that attempts to fly :))
